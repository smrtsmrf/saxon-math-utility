<h1 class="text-center">Getting Started</h1>
<!-- <ol>
	<li>Only administrators are authorized to modify the homework. To make modifications, click the title on the homework page, then on the grid of buttons that displays, choose what modifications you wish to make and then click the "update" button.</li>
	<li>Teachers are able to request modifications to the homework. Instead of being able to update the homework, they are given the option to either request an update or enter an admin key.
		<ul>
			<li>Request an update: after the teacher provides some reasoning for the request, an email is automatically sent to the administrator. (If there are multiple administrators for your school, the email will only be sent to the first administrator.) This email provides the administrator with the request information, as well as a button to login and make the changes themselves, and a button to instead send an admin key (via automatic email) so the teacher can make the changes.</li>
			<li>Enter an admin key: If an administrator has chosen to send an admin key, the teacher can enter this admin key in order to make the changes that were requested. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In order to prevent students from maliciously or accidentally registering for an administrator or teacher account, a verification code is required. The same code you used to register will be used for all administrators and teachers connected with your school.</li>
	<li>The reset button on the left hand side of the modify homework pages will reset which lessons are skipped back to what they were when you logged in (teacher) or when you last updated the homework (admin). </li>
	<li>The reset button on the admin page will reset all subjects back to their initial state of not skipping any lessons.</li>
	<li>Users associated with your school are displayed and can be deleted on the admin page. </li>
	<li>Student accounts can be created on the admin page. They can be created one at a time, or up to 3 at a time. Usernames must be unique, so consider using your school name as part of the username. If "alg", "geo", or "alg2" is part of the username, then when students login, they will be directed to the appropriate homework page. If the username does not contain those subject abbreviations, the default behavior is to go to the algebra homework page. The idea is that there will be a generic account for all algebra users, one for all geometry users, and one for all algebra 2 users. Though if you need to create more users you are welcome to do so.</li>
	<li>At this time there is no "password reset" or "forgot username/password" feature. Your email address can only be associated with one account, so please write down your username/password in a secure location.</li>
</ol> -->

<ol>
	<li><b>Create Student Accounts: </b>To create student accounts, click on the Create Student Accounts link on the left sidebar. You may create up to 3 accounts at a time. The idea is that there will be a generic account for all algebra users, one for all geometry users, and one for all algebra 2 users. Though if you need to create more users you are welcome to do so. Usernames must be unique, so consider using your school name as part of the username. If "alg", "geo", or "alg2" is part of the username, then students will be directed to the appropriate homework page after login. </li>
	<li><b>Modify HW: </b> Only administrator accounts are authorized to make changes to the homework, but teachers may submit modification requests. To access the modification page, click on the title on the homework page. 
		<ul>
			<li><b>Administrators: </b>On the modifications page, click on the lesson number you want to skip, turning the button grey. When you have finished selecting which lessons you want to skip, click the "update" button at the bottom of the page, and it will redirect you to the newly modified homework. </li>
			<li><b>Teachers: </b>Teachers follow the same process to modify the homework, but instead of the modification being made, they are prompted to either submit an update request, or enter an admin key.
				<ul>
					<li><b>Submit a Request: </b>Teachers explain their reasoning, and upon submission, an email is sent to the administrator with the request and reasoning. This email contains a link for administrators to make the change themselves, or send an admin key back to the requesting teacher.</li>
					<li><b>Enter an Admin Key: </b>If the administrator chooses to send an admin key, an email is generated and sent to the requesting teacher. The teacher then can copy and paste this code into the request box (after clicking the request update button and selecting "enter admin key") and then the request will be implemented.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Reset Homework: </b>There are two places that you may reset the homework - on the modifications page, and on the "Reset HW" part of the admin page.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Modifications page: </b>A reset button appears underneath the subject you are currently viewing. Clicking this will go back to not skipping any lessons in this subject. For teachers, this button works differently: clicking it will go back to not making any changes to the current homework.</li>
			<li><b>Admin page: </b> Clicking the "Reset HW" link on the left sidebar will give you the option to reset ALL subjects back to not skipping any lessons.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>View/Delete Users: </b>Clicking on the "Users" link on the left sidebar will allow you to view all users associated with your school (admins, teachers, and students). You may also delete users from this page. Be careful, as this cannot be undone.
	</li>
	<li><b>Forgot password: </b>At this time there is no "password reset" or "forgot username/password" feature. Your email address can only be associated with one account, so please write down your username/password in a secure location.</li>
